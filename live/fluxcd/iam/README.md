# iam

Currently this is based on some open-source image and not build by us or maintained. The plan is to make the bitnami/keycloak and bitnami/postgresql images arm64 compatible and use these. But this is major work to be done and therefore pushed back, since we have the first main goal of a working auth POC.

Additionally we are exploring the use of another auth and iam solution called ***Ory***
